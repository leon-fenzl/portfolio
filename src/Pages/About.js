            Hi there! My name is León Fenzl,<br/>
            Game Artist & Programmer.<br/>
            I have over 5 years of experience in digital game development, <br/>
            working as a consultant and game designer, as well as a 3D modeler <br/>
            and programmer. <br/>
            My mission is to create engaging digital experiences that combine <br/>
            aesthetics and functionality, without forgetting that fun is the main <br/>
            focus of the gaming experience!
